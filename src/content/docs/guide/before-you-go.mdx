import Citation from "../../../components/Citation.astro";

Before setting out for Hajj, it is essential to prepare yourself spiritually, mentally, and practically. This journey is unlike any other — it requires a sincere heart, a sound plan, and a resilient mindset.

---

## 1. Purify Your Intention

Hajj is not a holiday or a formality. It is an act of devotion that requires sincerity and humility.

- Make sure your intention is solely to seek the pleasure of Allah.
- Avoid any desire for praise, recognition, or competition.
- Reflect on the hadith: _"Whoever performs Hajj and does not commit any obscenity or sin will return as free from sins as the day his mother bore him."_ (Bukhari, Muslim)

---

## 2. Repentance and Settling Affairs

Hajj is a time for returning to Allah with a clean heart.

- Sincerely repent for all past sins.
- Ask forgiveness from anyone you have wronged — in person or remotely.
- Write your wasiyyah (Islamic will), even if you are young and healthy.
- Clear debts and obligations as much as possible.
- Appoint someone to manage your affairs in case of emergency.

## 3. Learn the Rites Properly

Do not rely solely on your group leaders or guides.

- Study the correct way to perform Hajj, based on the Sunnah.
- Understand the difference between Tamattu’, Qiran, and Ifrad.
- Learn what is fard (obligatory), wajib (necessary), sunnah, and what breaks Ihram.
- Memorize or carry key duas and the sequence of rituals.

Refer to the [Checklists](/reference/checklists) and [Glossary](/reference/glossary) for summaries.

## 4. Mental Preparation

The physical strain and logistical issues can be overwhelming.

- Expect long walks, extreme heat, waiting in crowds, and basic accommodations.
- Accept that things will go wrong — and respond with patience.
- Lower your expectations from people, and raise your expectations from Allah.
- Constantly remind yourself that Hajj is a trial of submission, not comfort.

## 5. Practical Preparation

Some items you carry will make a significant difference during the days of Hajj.

- Ihram clothing (2 white unstitched cloths for men; modest attire for women)
- Unscented toiletries, flip flops, water bottle, ID pouch
- Basic medicines, plasters, masks, and disinfectant wipes
- A small bag for shoes during Tawaf and Sa’ee
- Printed dua booklets or a reliable app for adhkar

See the [Checklists page](/reference/checklists) for more detailed packing suggestions.

## 6. Prepare Family and Personal Matters

- Share your itinerary and emergency contact details with loved ones.
- Make peace with family and community members if relationships are strained.
- Arrange care for children, elderly parents, or anyone who depends on you.
- Ensure your financial and legal responsibilities are taken care of.

## 7. Learn the Talbiyah and Key Adhkar

You’ll recite the Talbiyah repeatedly from the moment you enter Ihram.

  transliteration="Labbayk Allahumma Labbayk. Labbayka laa shareeka laka Labbayk. Innal-hamda wan-ni’mata laka wal-mulk. Laa shareeka lak."
  translation="I respond to Your call O Allah! I respond to Your call. You have no partner. I respond to Your call. All praise, thanks and blessings are for You. All sovereignty is for You. And You have no partners with You."

Also review morning and evening adhkar, and du'as specific to each major ritual.

## Final Advice

Hajj is a life-changing journey. Your experience depends not on how smooth things go, but on how you respond. Be grateful, be patient, and be intentional. You are a guest of Allah — act like one.
