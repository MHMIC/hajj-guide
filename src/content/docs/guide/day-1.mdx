import Citation from '../../../components/Citation.astro';

The 8th of Dhul Hijjah is called **Yawm at-Tarwiyah**. It marks the beginning of the Hajj rites. Pilgrims travel to **Mina**, where they spend the day and night in worship, preparing for the standing at Arafah the next day.

## 1. Re-enter Ihram (if performing Tamattu’)

If you completed Umrah earlier and exited Ihram, today you make a fresh intention for Hajj and re-enter Ihram.

> Intention: _Labbaika Hajjan_ — “O Allah, I intend Hajj.”

Recite the **Talbiyah** frequently once in Ihram:

  transliteration="Labbayk Allahumma Labbayk, Labbayka lā sharīka laka Labbayk, innal-ḥamda wan-ni‘mata laka wal-mulk, lā sharīka lak."

## 2. Depart to Mina

After sunrise, head to **Mina** (about 8 km from Makkah). Walking is encouraged if physically possible, otherwise any means of transport may be used.

The Prophet ﷺ left for Mina on the 8th of Dhul Hijjah and prayed there.

<Citation
  translation="It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbas that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed in Mina, on the Day of Tarwiyah (the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah), Zuhr, 'Asr', Maghrib, 'Isha' and Fajr, then he went in the morning to 'Arafat."

## 3. Pray Dhuhr to Fajr in Mina

You should offer:

- Dhuhr
- Asr
- Maghrib
- Isha (all on the 8th)
- Fajr (on the 9th)

All prayers are to be offered **shortened** (2 rak‘at) and **on time** — **not combined**.

<Citation
  translation="The Prophet ﷺ prayed Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha in Mina, shortening the prayers, each at its proper time."

## 4. Spend the Night in Mina

Remaining in Mina overnight is a **Sunnah Mu’akkadah** — a highly emphasized Sunnah. The Prophet ﷺ and companions did not skip it, and there is no report of them spending this night elsewhere.

## Historical Note: Why It’s Called Yawm at-Tarwiyah

“Tarwiyah” refers to preparing for the Day of Arafah. Historically, pilgrims would draw and store water for the journey to Arafah — hence the name.
