import Citation from "../../../components/Citation.astro";

Hajj is a journey of submission, not convenience. It strips away comfort, ego, and routine — leaving you face-to-face with yourself and your Creator. A successful Hajj begins with the right mindset and intention.

## Sincerity of Purpose (Niyyah)

Every act in Hajj — from donning the Ihram to stoning the Jamaraat — only has value if it’s rooted in sincerity. You are not performing for others. You are answering a divine call.

## Cultivating Patience (Sabr)

Sabr is not a bonus trait during Hajj — it’s an absolute requirement. From delays to discomfort, Hajj will test your patience daily.

<Citation
  arabic="يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اسْتَعِينُوا بِالصَّبْرِ وَالصَّلَاةِ"
  translation="O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer."
  source="Qur’an 2:153"
/>

Patience is not passive. It is an active choice to restrain anger, endure difficulty, and maintain dignity. Hajj offers countless opportunities to exercise this — in queues, in tents, and in heat.

<Citation
  arabic="إِنَّمَا يُوَفَّى الصَّابِرُونَ أَجْرَهُم بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ"
  translation="Indeed, the patient will be given their reward without account."
  source="Qur’an 39:10"
/>

## Set Your Expectations

As Yasir Qadhi put it bluntly: if you're expecting luxury, you're not ready for Hajj.

<Citation
  translation="Set your expectations low — from the people — and high — from Allah. That’s the Hajj mindset."
  source="Yasir Qadhi – Hajj Lecture, 2022"
/>

Expect heat, crowds, confusion, poor logistics. Still — never forget that you are a guest of Ar-Rahman. How you behave in these moments defines the spiritual success of your Hajj.

## Focus on Your Journey

You are not responsible for others. You are not on a group tour. You are a servant, standing before your Master.

- Don’t waste time judging others' actions.
- Don’t chase every lecture, video, or group activity.
- Focus on dhikr, du’a, and self-reflection.

## Keep the Talbiyah Close

Repeat it frequently. Reflect on its meaning.

<Citation
  arabic="لَبَّيْكَ اللَّهُمَّ لَبَّيْكَ. لَبَّيْكَ لَا شَرِيكَ لَكَ لَبَّيْكَ. إِنَّ الْحَمْدَ وَالنِّعْمَةَ لَكَ وَالْمُلْكَ. لَا شَرِيكَ لَكَ."
  translation="Labbayk Allahumma Labbayk. Labbayka laa shareeka laka Labbayk. Innal-hamda wan-ni’mata laka wal-mulk. Laa shareeka lak."
  source="Talbiyah – Reported in Bukhari"
/>

It is your answer to Allah's call. Say it with awe.

## Final Advice

If you want a “comfortable” Hajj, stay home. If you want a **transformational** one, embrace the struggle. Walk into it with humility, patience, and the intention to come out changed.
