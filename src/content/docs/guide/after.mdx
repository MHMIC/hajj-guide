import Citation from '../../../components/Citation.astro';

Completing the rites of Hajj is a major milestone — but your spiritual journey continues. The Prophet ﷺ emphasized both reflection and vigilance after Hajj.

## 1. Perform Tawaf al-Wada’ (Farewell Tawaf)

Before leaving Makkah, every pilgrim must perform a final circumambulation of the Ka‘bah.

<Citation
  translation="The people were ordered to make the Tawaf of the Ka‘bah the last thing before leaving (Makkah), except for menstruating women."
  source="Sahih al-Bukhari 1755"

/>

- This is **obligatory** for all pilgrims **except** menstruating women.
- Perform 7 circuits around the Ka‘bah in the usual manner.

## 2. Reflect and Renew Commitment

The Prophet ﷺ said:

<Citation
  translation="Whoever performs Hajj and does not engage in sexual relations, nor commit sin or dispute unjustly during Hajj, will return like the day his mother gave birth to him."
  source="Sahih al-Bukhari 1521"
  sourceLink="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1521"
/>

If your Hajj was sincere and accepted, your sins are forgiven. Let that clean slate reflect in your character and choices moving forward.

## 3. Signs of an Accepted Hajj

Scholars mention signs that Hajj was accepted:

- Change in behavior and increased obedience
- Detachment from sinful habits
- Love for dhikr, Qur’an, salah, and righteous company
- Continued humility and reliance on Allah

Ibn al-Qayyim رحمه الله said:  
_“The sign of an accepted Hajj is that after returning, a person becomes better than before.”_

## 4. Stay Connected to the Spirit of Hajj

- Make sincere du‘a often
- Guard your five daily prayers
- Practice sabr and ihsan with people
- Increase in Qur’an and charity
- Avoid old sinful habits

---

## 5. Share the Experience

- Teach others what you learned
- Be grateful, not arrogant
- Recognize: this was an invitation from Allah ﷻ — not your own merit

---

## 6. Visiting Madinah (Optional)

While not part of Hajj, it is highly recommended to visit **Madinah** and pray in the Prophet’s ﷺ mosque.

<Citation
  translation="One prayer in my mosque is better than a thousand prayers elsewhere, except Al-Masjid Al-Haram."
  source="Sahih al-Bukhari 1190"

/>

See [Visiting Madinah](/guide/visiting-madinah) for detailed etiquette.
