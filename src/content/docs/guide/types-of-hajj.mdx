There are three valid ways to perform Hajj: **Tamattu’**, **Qiran**, and **Ifrad**. Each has a specific method of combining Hajj and Umrah.

---

## 1. Hajj Tamattu’ (تَمَتُّع)

You perform **Umrah** first during the Hajj season, exit Ihram, then enter **a new Ihram for Hajj** on the 8th of Dhul Hijjah.

- Most common for international pilgrims
- Requires **two separate Ihrams**
- **Animal sacrifice (Hady)** is mandatory

**Sequence:**
1. Enter Ihram at Miqat for Umrah
2. Perform Tawaf, Sa’ee, then trim hair and exit Ihram
3. Re-enter Ihram on 8th Dhul Hijjah for Hajj

  translation="Whoever performs Umrah [during the Hajj months], followed by Hajj, must offer what can be afforded of sacrificial animal."
  source="Qur’an 2:196"

## 2. Hajj Qiran (قِرَان)

You perform **Umrah and Hajj together** with **a single Ihram**.

- Ihram is entered with the intention of both Umrah and Hajj
- No exiting Ihram after Umrah
- **Animal sacrifice is mandatory**
- Preferred by scholars like Abu Hanifa

**Sequence:**
1. Enter Ihram at Miqat with dual intention
2. Perform Tawaf and Sa’ee for Umrah
3. Remain in Ihram through the days of Hajj
4. Perform Tawaf and Sa’ee for Hajj

## 3. Hajj Ifrad (إِفْرَاد)

You perform **only Hajj** with no Umrah before it.

- Single Ihram for Hajj only
- No sacrifice required (but recommended)
- Preferred by residents of Makkah or those coming straight for Hajj

**Sequence:**
1. Enter Ihram for Hajj at Miqat
2. Perform all rites of Hajj
3. No Umrah performed before or during Hajj days

## Which One Should You Choose?

| Type     | Umrah Before? | Sacrifice? | No. of Ihrams | Suitable For             |
|----------|----------------|------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Tamattu’ | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Required | 2              | Most international pilgrims |
| Qiran    | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Required | 1              | Those arriving early with animals |
| Ifrad    | ❌ No          | ❌ Not required | 1           | Local or early pilgrims without Umrah |

Tamattu’ is easiest and was encouraged by the Prophet ﷺ for his companions when they didn’t bring animals with them.
