import Citation from '../../../../components/Citation.astro';

**Sa’ee** is the walking between the hills of **Safa** and **Marwa**, performed after Tawaf. It commemorates the struggle of **Hājar**, the mother of Ismā‘īl عليه السلام, in her desperate search for water in the barren desert of Makkah.

## 1. Qur’anic Origin

<Citation
  arabic="إِنَّ الصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةَ مِن شَعَائِرِ اللَّهِ ۖ فَمَنْ حَجَّ الْبَيْتَ أَوِ اعْتَمَرَ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِ أَن يَطَّوَّفَ بِهِمَا"
  transliteration="Inna aṣ-Ṣafā wal-Marwata min sha‘ā’irillāh. Fa man ḥajja al-bayta awi‘tamara falā junāḥa ‘alayhi an yaṭṭawwafa bihimā..."
  translation="Indeed, Safa and Marwa are among the symbols of Allah. So whoever makes Hajj to the House or performs ‘Umrah — there is no blame upon him for walking between them."

## 2. Timing of Sa’ee

- **In ‘Umrah**: After **Tawaf**.
- **In Hajj**:
  - **Tamattu‘**: Sa’ee is performed after **Tawaf of ‘Umrah** before exiting Ihram.
  - **Ifrād / Qirān**: Sa’ee is done after **Tawaf al-Ifādah**.

> ✅ *Fatwa*: Sa’ee must follow a valid Tawaf. If done before it (without a valid reason), it is not accepted.

## 3. Conditions of Valid Sa’ee

- Must begin at **Safa** and end at **Marwa**.
- Must be **7 complete circuits**. Each leg (Safa→Marwa or vice versa) counts as one.
- Must follow **Tawaf** (not precede it).
- Continuous, though **rest is allowed**.
- **Taharah (wudu)** is recommended, but not required.

> ✅ *Fatwa*: Being in a state of wudu is not a condition for Sa’ee but is **mustahabb** (recommended).

## 4. How to Perform Sa’ee (Step-by-Step)

1. At **Safa**, face the Ka’bah and recite:

<Citation
  arabic="إِنَّ الصَّفَا وَالْمَرْوَةَ مِن شَعَائِرِ اللَّهِ"
  transliteration="Inna aṣ-Ṣafā wal-Marwata min sha‘ā’irillāh"
  translation="Indeed, Safa and Marwa are among the symbols of Allah"
  source="Sahih Muslim 1218"
  sourceLink="https://sunnah.com/muslim:1218"
/>

> Then say: _Abda’u bimā bad’allāhu bih_ — “I begin with what Allah began with.”

2. Make **du‘a** at Safa, facing the Ka’bah. Repeat three times if possible.

3. Walk to **Marwa**. Between the two green lights, **men** jog (raml), women walk normally.

4. At **Marwa**, repeat the dhikr and du‘a.

5. Return to Safa and repeat steps until completing 7 rounds. Ends at **Marwa**.

---

## 5. Rules for Women

- Women do **not jog** between green lights.
- They may perform Sa’ee during menstruation **if Tawaf was already valid**.

> ✅ *Fatwa*: A woman who becomes menstruating **after** Tawaf may do Sa’ee without issue.  
> [IslamQA Fatwa 21007](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/21007)

---

## 6. Common Mistakes

- Starting from **Marwa** instead of Safa (invalid).
- Performing less than 7 rounds.
- Treating Sa’ee as casual walking or socialising.
- Not following up **immediately after Tawaf** without a valid reason.

> ✅ *Fatwa*: Delaying Sa’ee excessively without reason is disliked; it should ideally be done immediately.

## 7. Spiritual Reminder

Sa’ee is a ritual full of **tawakkul** and **sabr**. It honours Hajar’s resolve — a single mother left in the desert, trusting Allah fully.

The Prophet ﷺ said:

<Citation
  translation="May Allah have mercy on the mother of Isma'il. Had she not hurried, the Zamzam would have been a flowing stream on the surface."
