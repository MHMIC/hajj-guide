## When to Perform It

- For **‘Umrah**: After **Tawaf + Sa’ee**, Halq/Taqsir ends the Umrah.
- For **Hajj**:
  - On **10th Dhul Hijjah** (after Rami and Sacrifice).
  - **Halq or Taqsir completes the partial exit** from Ihram.

## Preference for Halq Over Taqsir

The Prophet ﷺ said:

<Citation
  translation="O Allah, forgive those who shave their heads. They said: 'And those who cut their hair short, O Messenger of Allah?' He said: 'O Allah, forgive those who shave their heads.' They repeated it, and on the fourth time, he said: 'And those who cut their hair short.'"
