**Ihram** is the sacred state a pilgrim enters to perform Hajj or Umrah. It involves an intention, specific clothing, and a set of restrictions aimed at maximizing sincerity and humility before Allah ﷻ.

---

## Meaning and Purpose

"Ihram" comes from the root ḥaram, implying prohibition. It marks a spiritual zone in which worldly indulgences are suspended in favor of focused devotion.

---

## Where to Enter Ihram: Al-Miqāt

The Prophet ﷺ said:

<Citation
  translation="The Miqat for the people of Madinah is Dhu’l-Hulayfah, for the people of Sham is al-Juhfah, for the people of Najd is Qarn al-Manazil, for the people of Yemen is Yalamlam..."
  source="Sahih al-Bukhari 1524"

/>

You must enter Ihram **before crossing the Miqat** specific to your route.
