title: Sacrifice (Hady, Ḍam, Nahr)
description: Understanding the Hajj sacrifice, its types, rulings, and how it differs from Eid al-Adha Udhiyah.
---

import Citation from '../../../../components/Citation.astro';

**Sacrifice in Hajj** refers primarily to **Hady (الهدي)** — the animal offered by certain pilgrims during Hajj. It's a distinct obligation from the **Eid al-Adha Udhiyah**, and should not be confused with **Ḍam**, which refers to a penalty.

## Types of Sacrificial Terms

- **Hady (الهدي):** General term for the sacrificial offering during Hajj.
- **Nahr (النحر):** Refers to the act of slaughter, especially of camels on 10th Dhul Hijjah.
- **Ḍam (الدم):** Refers to a penalty sacrifice for mistakes or missed rites.
