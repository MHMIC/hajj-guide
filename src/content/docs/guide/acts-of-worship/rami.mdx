import Citation from '../../../../components/Citation.astro';

**Rami al-Jamarāt** is the ritual of throwing pebbles at the three stone pillars in Mina during the **Days of Tashreeq** (11th–13th Dhul Hijjah), and at the **Jamarah al-‘Aqabah** on the 10th. It is done to symbolize the rejection of Shayṭān and submission to Allah ﷻ.

---

## Purpose and Origin

The practice commemorates the actions of **Prophet Ibrāhīm عليه السلام**, who was confronted by Shayṭān at these three locations and repelled him by throwing stones.

## Step-by-Step: Rami on 11th–13th Dhul Hijjah

Each day after **Dhuhr**:

1. Start with **Small Jamarah (Sughra)** – 7 pebbles
2. Then **Middle Jamarah (Wusta)** – 7 pebbles
3. Then **Big Jamarah (‘Aqabah)** – 7 pebbles

At the **first two**, pause after stoning and make **du‘a facing Qiblah**. After the third, **no du‘a** — just exit.

## Rules and Etiquette

- Collect **49–70 small pebbles** from **Muzdalifah** (or Mina if needed)
- Pebbles should be **small**, about the size of a chickpea
- Only **one pebble per throw**
- Do **not throw violently** or aim at people

---

## For Women and the Elderly

- May **delegate** Rami if crowded or unsafe
  > 🔗 [IslamQA: Rami by proxy](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/39396)
- The person must be **unable**, not just inconvenienced
- A **single person can stone on behalf of multiple others** (e.g., husband for wife and parent)

---

## Common Mistakes

- Throwing **multiple stones** at once
- Throwing from **far outside** the designated area
- Skipping the **order** (must do Small → Middle → Big)
- Making du‘a after the third Jamarah
