These days — the 11th, 12th, and optionally the 13th of Dhul Hijjah — are known as the **Days of Tashreeq**. Pilgrims remain in **Mina**, continue stoning the three pillars, and spend time in dhikr and worship.

## 1. Stoning the Three Jamarat

Each day, you must stone the following:

- **Jamrat al-Sughra** (small)
- **Jamrat al-Wusta** (middle)
- **Jamrat al-‘Aqabah** (large)

You throw **7 pebbles at each**, one at a time, saying _Allahu Akbar_ with each throw.

/>

**Timing:** It is Sunnah to perform Rami **after Dhuhr** and before Maghrib. It is permissible to delay it until sunset.

## 2. Stay in Mina

- Pilgrims must remain in Mina during the nights of the 11th and 12th.
- Staying in Mina these nights is **obligatory**, unless excused (e.g., for serving pilgrims or urgent medical needs).

<Citation
  translation="Ibn ‘Umar used to say: 'It is Sunnah to spend the nights of the Days of Tashreeq in Mina.' Ibn al-Mundhir said: 'The scholars are unanimously agreed that staying overnight in Mina on the nights of the Days of Tashreeq is obligatory for those who are able.'"

## 3. Du‘a After Stoning

- After stoning **Jamrat al-Sughra** and **al-Wusta**, pause and make du‘a.
- After **Jamrat al-‘Aqabah**, **do not** stop for du‘a — move on.

This was the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ.

## 4. Option to Leave on the 12th

Allah says:

<Citation
  arabic="فَمَن تَعَجَّلَ فِي يَوْمَيْنِ فَلَا إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ وَمَنْ تَأَخَّرَ فَلَا إِثْمَ عَلَيْهِ لِمَنِ اتَّقَى"
  transliteration="Faman ta‘ajjala fī yawmayn fa-lā ithma ‘alayh, waman ta’akhkhara fa-lā ithma ‘alayhi limani ittaqā"
  translation="Whoever hastens [to leave] after two days – there is no sin upon him; and whoever delays – there is no sin upon him – for whoever fears Allah."
  source="Qur’an 2:203"
  sourceLink="https://quran.com/2/203"
/>

- You may leave Mina **before sunset on the 12th** (after Rami) — no penalty.
- If you stay for the 13th, repeat the same stoning routine.
