Visiting **Madinah** is not a part of Hajj or Umrah, but it is a noble Sunnah. The city of the Prophet ﷺ carries immense spiritual value, and visiting it can increase love for him and deepen your connection to his legacy.

## 1. Pray in the Prophet’s ﷺ Mosque

The Prophet ﷺ said:

<Citation
  translation="One prayer in my mosque is better than a thousand prayers elsewhere, except Al-Masjid Al-Haram."
  source="Sahih al-Bukhari 1190"

/>

Take advantage of this blessing and pray as much as possible during your stay.

## 2. Visit al-Rawdah

The space between the Prophet’s ﷺ house and his minbar is called **Rawdah**, and the Prophet ﷺ said:

<Citation
  translation="What is between my house and my pulpit is a garden from the gardens of Paradise."
  source="Sahih al-Bukhari 1196"
  sourceLink="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1196"
/>

You’ll need to book a time slot using the **Nusuk app**. Enter with humility and focus.

## 3. Send Salawat Upon the Prophet ﷺ

Visit the grave of the Prophet ﷺ, along with Abu Bakr and Umar رضي الله عنهما. Stand respectfully, do **not** raise your voice or supplicate to them.

Say:

> _As-salāmu ‘alayka yā RasūlAllāh..._  
> _As-salāmu ‘alayka yā Abā Bakr..._  
> _As-salāmu ‘alayka yā ‘Umar..._

Avoid facing the grave while praying — always face the Qiblah.

---

## 4. General Etiquette

- Do not treat the visit as a sightseeing trip.
- Lower your voice and maintain adab in the city.
- Refrain from any innovation (bid‘ah) in word or deed.
- Spend time in remembrance, Qur’an, and salawat.

---

## 5. Historical Sites (Optional)

You may also visit:

- **Mount Uhud** (site of the Battle of Uhud)
- **Masjid Quba** — the first masjid in Islam
- **Masjid Qiblatayn** — where Qiblah was changed

These visits are permissible, but not required.
