import Citation from '../../../components/Citation.astro';

The 10th of Dhul Hijjah is the **Day of Eid**, and one of the most intense and spiritually significant days of Hajj. It involves multiple major rites.

---

## 1. Stay the Night in Muzdalifah

After Maghrib and Isha prayers on the night of the 9th (combined at Muzdalifah), pilgrims sleep in the open at **Muzdalifah**.

- It is Sunnah to remain until **Fajr**.
- Women, the elderly, and those with valid reasons may leave **after midnight**.

## 2. Pray Fajr at Muzdalifah and Make Du‘a

- After Fajr, move to **Mash‘ar al-Haram** if possible (a specific area in Muzdalifah).
- Stand facing the Qiblah and make intense du‘a until just before sunrise.

  translation="There is no blame on you for seeking the bounty of your Lord ˹during this journey˺. When you return from ’Arafât, praise Allah near the sacred place and praise Him for having guided you, for surely before this ˹guidance˺ you were astray."

## 3. Collect Pebbles

- Pick **7 small pebbles** (roughly the size of a chickpea) for stoning **Jamrat al-‘Aqabah**.
- These pebbles should be clean and collected **from Muzdalifah**.

---

## 4. Proceed to Mina and Perform Rami

- Go to **Jamrat al-‘Aqabah** (the large pillar).
- Throw **7 pebbles**, one at a time, saying:

> _Allahu Akbar_ with each throw.

## 5. Offer the Sacrifice (Hady)

- If performing **Hajj Tamattu’ or Qiran**, sacrifice is **obligatory**.
- For **Hajj Ifrad**, it is **recommended**.
- You may arrange it in advance or witness it being done.

<Citation
  arabic="فَمَن تَمَتَّعَ بِالْعُمْرَةِ إِلَى الْحَجِّ فَمَا اسْتَيْسَرَ مِنَ الْهَدْيِ"
  transliteration="Faman tamatta‘a bil-‘umrati ilā al-ḥajji famā is’taysara mina al-hadyi"
  translation="Whoever performs Umrah [and then] Hajj, let him offer what he can afford of the sacrifice."
  source="Qur’an 2:196"
  sourceLink="https://quran.com/2/196"
/>

---

## 6. Shave or Trim the Hair

- **Men**: Shaving (Halq) is best. Trimming (Taqsir) is allowed.
- **Women**: Clip a fingertip’s length from the end of the hair.

<Citation
  translation="May Allah have mercy on those who shave... and those who trim."
  source="Sahih al-Bukhari 1720"

/>

After this, you exit the state of Ihram (except for intimacy).

---

## 7. Tawaf al-Ifadah (Optional on This Day)

If you have time and energy, you may perform **Tawaf al-Ifadah** today. It is a **pillar of Hajj**, but can also be delayed to later days.
