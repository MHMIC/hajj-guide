Umrah is the lesser pilgrimage — a concise but highly rewarding act of worship. Unlike Hajj, it is not restricted to specific dates and can be performed year-round.

## Pillars of Umrah

Umrah has **four essential components**:

1. **Ihram** – Intention from the Miqat, entering the sacred state.
2. **Tawaf** – Circling the Ka‘bah seven times.
3. **Sa’ee** – Walking between the hills of Safa and Marwah.
4. **Halq or Taqsir** – Shaving or trimming the hair.

Leaving out any of these invalidates the Umrah.

## Step-by-Step: Performing Umrah

### 1. Entering Ihram at the Miqat

- Cleanse yourself, wear the Ihram garments, and make the niyyah (intention) for Umrah.
- Begin reciting the **Talbiyah**:  

<Citation
  arabic="لَبَّيْكَ اللَّهُمَّ لَبَّيْكَ، لَبَّيْكَ لَا شَرِيكَ لَكَ لَبَّيْكَ، إِنَّ الْحَمْدَ وَالنِّعْمَةَ لَكَ وَالْمُلْكَ، لَا شَرِيكَ لَكَ"
  transliteration="Labbayk Allahumma Labbayk, Labbayka lā sharīka laka Labbayk, innal-ḥamda wan-ni‘mata laka wal-mulk, lā sharīka lak."
  translation="Here I am, O Allah, here I am. Here I am, You have no partner, here I am. Verily, all praise, grace, and sovereignty belong to You. You have no partner."
  source="Sahih al-Bukhari 1549"

/>

### 2. Tawaf of the Ka‘bah

- Begin at the Black Stone, saying “Bismillah, Allahu Akbar”.
- Complete 7 counter-clockwise circuits.
- Men: uncover the right shoulder (Idtiba) and jog lightly (Ramal) in the first 3 circuits.
- After completing Tawaf, pray 2 rak‘at behind Maqam Ibrahim (if possible).

> There's no fixed du‘a during Tawaf; recite Qur’an, make du‘a, and glorify Allah from the heart.

### 3. Sa’ee Between Safa and Marwah

- Begin at Safa with the verse:

<Citation
  arabic="۞ إِنَّ ٱلصَّفَا وَٱلْمَرْوَةَ مِن شَعَآئِرِ ٱللَّهِ ۖ فَمَنْ حَجَّ ٱلْبَيْتَ أَوِ ٱعْتَمَرَ فَلَا جُنَاحَ عَلَيْهِ أَن يَطَّوَّفَ بِهِمَا ۚ وَمَن تَطَوَّعَ خَيْرًۭا فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَاكِرٌ عَلِيمٌ"
  translation="Indeed, Safa and Marwah are among the symbols of Allah."
  source="Qur’an 2:158"
  sourceLink="https://quran.com/2/158"
/>

- Walk to Marwah and back, completing 7 legs.
- Men jog between the green lights (Mas‘aa).
- There is no required du‘a; make personal supplications throughout.

### 4. Halq or Taqsir (Shaving or Trimming)

- **Men**: Shaving (Halq) is preferred; trimming (Taqsir) is allowed.
- **Women**: Trim a fingertip’s length from the end of the hair.

<Citation
  translation="May Allah have mercy on those who shave... and those who trim."
  source="Sahih al-Bukhari 1720"

/>

---

## What Invalidates Umrah

- Intimacy after entering Ihram and before completing all rites.
- Skipping any of the four pillars.
- Crossing the Miqat without donning Ihram.

> _Kitab ul Hajj_ emphasizes that even unintentional violations (e.g., scented soap) require kaffarah depending on severity.

## Spiritual Value of Umrah

Umrah is not simply a ritual — it's a chance to restart. The Prophet ﷺ said:

<Citation
  translation="The performance of ‘Umrah is an expiation for the sins committed between it and the previous one."
  source="Sahih al-Bukhari 1773"
